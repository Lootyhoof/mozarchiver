/**
 * Manages the saving process of all the resources required to render a
 * document, providing a single progress indication.
 *
 * This class derives from JobRunner. See the JobRunner documentation for
 * details.
 *
 * The saving process starts immediately with a reference collection phase. The
 * provided DOM document is examined, and a child job object is created for any
 * reference to additional content that should be saved. The type of the child
 * job object depends on the type of the referenced resource that has been
 * found. The following types of referenced resources are recognized:
 *   - Previously parsed DOM document (handled by ExactPersistParsedJob)
 *   - Previously parsed CSS stylesheet (handled by ExactPersistParsedJob)
 *   - Resource required for rendering (handled by ExactPersistUnparsedJob)
 *   - Resource not required for rendering (not handled by a save job)
 *
 * During this phase, the PersistBundle object of this job is populated with
 * one PersistResource object for each unique referenced resource, regardless of
 * whether the resource should be saved locally or not. At the same time, each
 * ExactPersistParsedJob object builds a list of ExactPersistReference objects,
 * that associates every reference with its target PersistResource.
 *
 * At this point, this save job is ready to start. The first child jobs to be
 * executed are those for unparsed resources, since a download failure is not
 * necessarily fatal, but may affect how the references in parsed resources are
 * updated later.
 *
 * When all the unparsed resources have been saved or skipped, the parsed
 * resources are saved by the ExactPersistParsedJob objects. When a parsed
 * resource is saved, all the web references that it contains are updated to
 * point to either the locally saved file, if present, or the original absolute
 * location of the target resource.
 *
 * Note that if the structure of a document involved in a save operation changes
 * while the operation is in progress, the web references found in newly created
 * DOM nodes or stylesheet rules will not be updated correctly.
 *
 * @param aDocument
 *        The document to be saved, which will be inspected to find additional
 *        related resources.
 * @param aTargetFile
 *        The nsIFile where the main document will be saved.
 * @param aTargetDataFolder
 *        The nsIFile of the support folder for data files.
